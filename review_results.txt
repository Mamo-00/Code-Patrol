The first code change is a YAML file that defines a GitHub workflow. The workflow is designed to run automated code reviews using AI tools. The workflow uses the `actions/checkout@v3` action to check out the code, and the `Mamo-00/Code-Patrol@master` action to perform the code review. The workflow also sets permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN and OPENAI_API_KEY environment variables.

The second code change is a JavaScript file that contains a component called Home. The component contains an h2 tag with a link to the Docs page. There are also two paragraphs of text, one of which is unchanged and the other of which has been modified.

Here are some improvements that could be made to the code changes:

1. In the YAML workflow file, the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is not used in the `Code-Patrol` action. It is possible that this variable is no longer needed, and removing it would simplify the workflow.
2. In the JavaScript file, the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable is not used anywhere. It is possible that this variable is not needed, and removing it would simplify the code.
3. In the YAML workflow file, the `with` key is used to pass environment variables to the `Code-Patrol` action. However, it is not clear what purpose the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable serves. It may be better to remove it and use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable directly in the workflow.
4. In the YAML workflow file, the `pull-requests` key is set to `write`, which means that the workflow will be triggered whenever a pull request is created or updated. However, it is possible that this is not what is desired, and it may be better to remove this key or set it to a more appropriate value.
5. In the JavaScript file, the `<p>` tag is used twice, but the second instance is not needed. It is possible that this tag can be removed.
6. In the JavaScript file, the `<a>` tag is used twice, but the second instance is not needed. It is possible that this tag can be removed.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you would like me to make any other changes.

## The Need for Automated Code Review
The need for such a tool arises from the fact that software development is inherently complex because it is prone to many errors. As the size of projects grows, so does the number of changes to the code, 
which makes the process of reviewing it manually not just time-consuming but also somewhat inconsistent. The importance of automated code review tools in modern-day software development is as follows:

- Reducing human error: Automatically catching errors that we as humans might miss.
- Saving time: Speeding up the review process by highlighting potential issues before reviewers look at the code.
- Standardizing code quality: Ensuring every part of the codebase adheres to predefined quality standards.
## How AI Enhances Code Review
Integrating Artificial Intelligence, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama, into the code review process introduces advanced capabilities:

- Contextual Understanding: Unlike traditional linters, AI can understand the context around code changes, offering more accurate and relevant feedback.
- Learning from Data: AI models learn from vast datasets, continuously improving their ability to provide feedback as they are exposed to more code.
- Adapting to Different Coding Styles: AI can be trained to understand and adapt to different coding styles and project-specific guidelines.
## Potential Impact of Code-Patrol
### For Developers
- Skill Improvement: Developers receive instant feedback on their code, helping them learn and improve their coding skills rapidly.
- Efficiency: Reduces the time developers spend on debugging and revisiting old code by catching potential issues early in the development cycle.
### For Teams
- Collaboration: Encourages a culture of feedback and continuous improvement within teams.
- Code Quality: Maintains high standards of code quality, leading to fewer bugs in production and higher overall project maintainability.
### For the Software Development Industry
- Scalability: Supports the scalability of development processes in large-scale projects by automating the time-consuming parts of code reviews.
- Innovation: Frees up developersâ€™ time to focus on more creative aspects of software development, potentially speeding up innovation.

## Challenges
There was an issue where sometimes the request sent with the API call would sometimes not work and isntead return the request sent, as the reponse instead. And so I had to change models. 
Also some models are not supported such as the chat models and some are not that easy to figure out if they would work or not so I had to test them out one by one. Which is also one of the reasons 
I have not added the functionality of the user being able to choose which model they use.  

## Conclusion
The Code-Patrol GitHub Action represents a significant step forward in automating and enhancing the code review process. 
By leveraging advanced AI, this tool not only improves individual and team productivity but also contributes to the broader goal of higher-quality software development across the industry. 
As AI technology evolves, tools like Code-Patrol are expected to become integral components of software development workflows, transforming how developers write, review, and learn from code.
